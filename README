crc32.usl:
/*
fnCRC32 - Calculates the crc32 polynomial of a string

Description: Generates the cyclic redundancy checksum polynomial of 32-bit lengths of the
             input. This is usually to validate the integrity of data being transmitted.
             
Return Values: Returns the crc32 checksum of input as an integer.

urlencode.usl:
/*
fnURLEncode - URL-encodes string

Description: This function is convenient when encoding a string to be used in a query part
             of a URL, as a convenient way to pass variables to the next page.
	     
Return Values: Returns a string in which all non-alphanumeric characters except -_. have
               been replaced with a percent (%) sign followed by two hex digits and spaces
               encoded as plus (+) signs. It is encoded the same way that the posted data
               from a WWW form is encoded, that is the same way as in
               application/x-www-form-urlencoded media type. This differs from the RFC 1738
               encoding in that for historical reasons, spaces are encoded as plus (+)
               signs.
